Or maybe you’re planning a big pool party for friends and family. But is your pool ready? How do you know? The answer is pool water testing.</p>\n<p>You probably already know how to test for basics like chlorine levels and pH balance. But what about phosphates? Or salt levels, if you have a salt water pool? Then there are potential contaminants like copper, iron, and calcium. If you’re leaving those out, you could be leaving your pool vulnerable to potential damage, not to mention an unsightly appearance.</p>\n<h2>Combating Contaminants</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4>You may also need to test more often if you have problems with your pool water, many of which can crop up due to the quality of the water you put in your pool. Well water contains more minerals, so you may see more copper and iron in your pool water. And if your city has hard water, the likelihood of high calcium levels is increased.</h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>These contaminants can make it more difficult to maintain the proper chemical balance in your pool, and they can stain and otherwise damage pool surfaces.</h4>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h4>Keeping an eye on them and preventing damage is more efficient and less costly than having to fix that damage later. And that prevention starts with pool water testing.</h4>\n</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"3693f2e8-4196-5953-9910-fe39e9e3962d"}}
