You’re looking forward to long, lazy afternoons relaxing in the crystal clear water. Or maybe you’re planning a big pool party for friends and family. But is your pool ready? How do you know? The answer is pool water testing.

Let us take care of keeping your water at the perfect balance. We monitor and add chemicals as often as needed to keep your pool in pristine condition.

## Combating Contaminants

- Problems with your pool water can crop up due to the quality of the water you put in your pool.

- Well water contains more minerals, so you may see more copper and iron in your pool water. And if your city has hard water, the likelihood of high calcium levels is increased.

- These contaminants can make it more difficult to maintain the proper chemical balance in your pool, and they can stain and otherwise damage pool surfaces.

- Keeping an eye on them and preventing damage is more efficient and less costly than having to fix that damage later. And that prevention starts with pool water testing.
